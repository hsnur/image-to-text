# image-to-text

# When you run the code, a window will open with a "Select Image" button. Clicking this button will open a file dialog where you can choose an image file. After selecting an image, the file path will be displayed on the window. Clicking the "Extract Text" button will extract the text from the image using Tesseract OCR and save it to a text file. The status label will display messages indicating the status of the extraction and saving process.

# Note: For the code to work, you must have Tesseract OCR installed on your system and its executable added to the system's PATH. Additionally, the Tesseract OCR accuracy can vary depending on factors such as image quality and font clarity. You may need to experiment with image preprocessing techniques or use other libraries to improve the results for specific images.


# To run this code, make sure you have the Tkinter, PIL, and pytesseract libraries installed. You can install them using pip:

# pip install tkinter
# #pip install pillow
# pip install pytesseract
